# CodeSample-ChalkRoads

This is a code sample from a game I programmed for a university course. The user has to fill in the icons (WhiteCircles) and escape from the blobs (BlackCircles). Developed in Unity using C#.

This game was developed two years ago, but the code was recently refactored for this sample. This is most of the logic; the only script missing is the "WhiteCircle" script. But, as this was a team effort, I uploaded only the code made by me.
